# What's this for?

During a V-Day in summar 2013, Raj articulated a vision of the VersionOne platform growing to service the needs of 1 million plus users. He emphasized that the platform architecture, and the overall business model, will have to adapt to accomplish this.

One of the first steps in growing our platform capabilities is for us to collectively increase our knowledge about and experience with building highly scalable app architectures.

So, use this repo to share links and ideas about this.

Greg Young (of DDD, CQRS, and CodeBetter, and SkillsMatter fame) will be coming to V1 in August for 3 days to work with the dev team on these subjects.

# First learning op: get prepared for Greg's visit

Greg is most well-known for his articulation and elaboration of the Command and Query Responsibility Segregation pattern.

To make the most of Greg's visit, a bunch of us started gathering in HipChat in CQRSetc to figure out a plan for studying some of Greg and others' materials on CQRS, etc before he arrives.

## Getting started links

Greg originally articulated CQRS in talks and blog posts like these:

* Blog: [CQRS, Task Based UIs, Event Sourcing agh!](http://codebetter.com/gregyoung/2010/02/16/cqrs-task-based-uis-event-sourcing-agh/)
* Video: [CQRS and Event Sourcing -- the Business Perspective](http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/home/greg-young-cqrs-event-sourcing-the-business-perspective)
* Many of Greg talks are archived for free viewing at his [SkillsMatter Profile](http://skillsmatter.com/expert/home/greg-young)
** Highly recommended: [Assert.That(We.Understand)](http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/home/talk-from-greg-young)
** Highly recommended: [Functional Data Storage](http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/home/greg-young)

Rinat Abdullin has done much to further CQRS, and collected tons of great summary info and detailed links here:

Udi Dahan co-pioneered the concepts with Greg, and authored many great blog posts, including:

* [CQRS Clarified](http://www.udidahan.com/2009/12/09/clarified-cqrs/) 

Martin Fowler summarized the pattern here:
